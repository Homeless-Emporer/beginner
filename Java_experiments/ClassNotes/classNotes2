CAPITALIZATION SCHEME: AllMyChildren for a class name (each word starts with a capital) allMyChildren for a method name (starts with a lowercase letter, subsequent words capitalized) ALL_MY_CHILDREN for a constant name (all uppercase, with words separated by underscores; 

AVOID KEYWORD NAMES

SYNTAX ERRORS: Mistakes made in the program cause by bad grammar
-if class name does not match file name
-mispell words
-capitalize words like System
-semicolon

LOGICAL ERRORS: Mistakes made that cause the code to misbehave
Also known as bugs
might produce the wrong output

RUNTIME ERROS: Logical errors so bad that the program has to stop running as its confused.
Logical errors that ask the program to do something it isnt capable of
